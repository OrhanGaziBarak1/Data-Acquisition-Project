With the wilt of the rose (ah-ha)
I slept all alone (ah-ha)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater
Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then
And is it over now?

When you lost control (ah-ha)
Red blood, white snow (ah-ha)
Blue dress on a boat (ah-ha)

I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye

But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend

You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
""F- the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night

Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside, like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me

All your little fake friends will sell your secrets for some cash
Smile in my face, then put your cig' out on my back

I knew a boy just like you
He's a snake, just like you
Such a fake, just like you
But I can see the truth

I can see right through, just so you know

Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the morning
When you got home from work

Making plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
All love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you

Now I remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice
Just tryna fix you and all your daddy issues
But now I don't even miss you anymore

So I, I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs

Stars by the pocketful

Tonight feels impossible

And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment

Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams, the culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya

You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new (yeah)

Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow
Out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

But you can't turn the radio down
And you can't think of anyone else
And love is when you try to make it out alive

And you can't think of anyone else

The Mona Lisa
I can hear your voice in the streets and the TV stations
And the police's
I can feel the strains on my wrist, I don't need these bracelets
Of all the things that she keeps in cages

Uh-huh, and she said

""I was 'bout to give you all of me on all the weekends
And all I wanted was apologies and all of your bed, uh""
Over my heels and fallin' on my head
But all of my feels were already dead
And if I could rewind it for you
If you could remind me of
